COVID-19 Chest X-ray Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This project is focused on the classification of chest X-ray images into four categories: Normal, Lung Opacity, Viral Pneumonia, and COVID-19 using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to explore and train different CNN architectures for automatic categorization, which can help in diagnosing COVID-19 and other lung diseases based on medical imaging.
Objective:

The objective of this exercise is to become familiar with creating and training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the automatic classification of chest X-ray images. The project uses a dataset containing images from various sources, organized into categories that represent different types of lung conditions.
Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is a collection of chest X-ray images categorized into the following classes:

    Normal
    Lung Opacity
    Viral Pneumonia
    COVID-19  Task Overview:

The task consists of the following key steps:

    Data Preprocessing: Implementing a custom dataset class (COVID19Dataset) to load and transform X-ray images into the required format.
    Model Training: Building and training CNN models (both shallow and deeper models) for classification tasks.
    Model Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and loss to evaluate the performance of the models.
    Fine-Tuning: Experimenting with a pre-trained model (ResNet50) to improve the model's accuracy.

Requirements:

    Python 3.x
    PyTorch
    Torchvision
    Matplotlib
    Google Colab or Kaggle (for GPU/TPU support)
